                 <h2>Project Overview:</h2>
                     <p>I designed a polished website for a henna artist to showcase her beautiful portfolio and simplify the appointment booking process. To add a personal touch, I captured custom photos of her work, ensuring the intricate designs were highlighted in an authentic and visually captivating way.
                        The site features several key pages: a Home page introducing the artistâ€™s services, an About Me section detailing her story and creative journey, an Events page listing upcoming workshops and henna events, a Contact page for easy client inquiries, 
                        and a user-friendly Booking page for seamless appointment scheduling. Following the initial launch, the website went through a round of user testing, with valuable feedback used to make enhancements. 
                       These adjustments helped fine-tune the design, ensuring the site was not only visually appealing but also intuitive and easy to navigate for both the client and her customers.</p>
