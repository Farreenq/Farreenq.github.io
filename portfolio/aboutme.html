        <h1>So Who Am I?</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Farreen. I am a Junior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst majoring in Operations Information Management, as well as a BDIC degree with an individual concentration in User Experience and Design.</p>
        <p>I have always been both a technical and creative individual and have found UI/UX to be the perfect mix of both.My interest in UI/UX design has led me to pursue a more out-of-the-box option regarding my degree.During my first year of college, I searched for a way to incorporate my love for art into my career choice and came upon UI/UX.</p>
        <p>However, UMass did not have a major for this which led me to take initiative and utilize resources to create a major of my own.At my time at UMass, I have developed both my technical and creative skills.I have developed a strong understanding of balancing user needs with a strategic business objective.</p>
        <p>My interdisciplinary background in Operations Information Management and my customized UI/UX design concentration has equipped me with expertise in data analysis, problem solving, user research, and design.This gives me the insight I need to analyze user data to improve business processes.</p>
